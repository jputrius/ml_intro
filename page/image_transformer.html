    <h1>Image classification using transformers</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to the main page.</a>
    <p>Transformers have been shown to outperform CNNs in image classification on large datasets.</p>
    <p>Build a transformer model for image classification. For inspiration you can use this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">paper</a>.</p>
    <p>Task steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Describe the model architecture you are going to use.</li>
      <li>2. Implement your model in PyTorch.</li>
      <li>3. Compare your model's performance on FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with the performance of a fine-tuned ResNet (compute accuracy, precision and recall).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that your model is probably not going to outperform ResNet on these small datasets. This is expected. You will be graded based on your code and understanding of the problem instead of, for example, getting a specific accuracy on CIFAR10.</p>
    <p>
      FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets ship with torchvision. You can find them <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#built-in-datasets">here</a>.
      Pretrained ResNet also ships with torchvision. You can find different versions <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/resnet.html">here</a>.</p>
