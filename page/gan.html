    <h1>Generating images using a generative adversarial network (GAN)</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to the main page.</a>
    <p>
      In this course we covered one type of generative models called denoising diffusion probabilistic models.
      There are other methods to train generative models.
      One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">generative adversarial networks (GANs)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Build a GAN to generate pictures of handwritten digits. Train your GAN on the MNIST dataset. You can start learning about GANs by reading the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">paper</a>.</p>
    <p>Task steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Describe the idea behind GANs and the model architecture you are going to use.</li>
      <li>2. Implement your model in PyTorch.</li>
      <li>3. Train your model and generate some samples.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will be graded based on your code and understanding of the problem.</p>
