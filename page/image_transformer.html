    <h1>Image classification using transformers</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to the main page.</a>
    <p>Transformers have been shown to outperform CNNs in image classification on some large datasets.</p>
    <p>Build a transformer model for image classification. For inspiration you can use this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">paper</a>.</p>
    <p>Task steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Describe the model architecture you are going to use.</li>
      <li>2. Implement your model in PyTorch.</li>
      <li>3. Compare your model's performance on FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets with the performance of a fine-tuned ResNet (compute accuracy, precision and recall).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that your model is probably not going to outperform ResNet on these small datasets. This is expected. Don't worry, you will not get a reduction in your grade.</p>
    <p>
      FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets ship with torchvision. You can find them <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#built-in-datasets">here</a>.
      Pretrained ResNet also ships with torchvision. You can find different versions <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/resnet.html">here</a>.</p>
