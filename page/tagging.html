    <h1>Part-of-speech tagging</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Back to the main page.</a>
    <p>
      The goal of part-of-speech tagging is to categorize words in a sentence based on their part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.).
      Read more about part-of-speech tagging on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging">wikipedia</a></p>
    <p>Build a transformer and LSTM based models to perform part-of-speech tagging.</p>
    <p>Task steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Describe the model architectures you are going to use.</li>
      <li>2. Implement your models in PyTorch.</li>
      <li>3. Compare your models' performance on <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/batterydata/pos_tagging">this dataset</a>. You can find the explanation of the tags <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wca/3.5.0?topic=analytics-part-speech-tag-sets">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will be graded based on your code and understanding of the problem.</p>
