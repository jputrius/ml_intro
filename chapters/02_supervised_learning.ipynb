    "# Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we looked at singular value decomposition and its applications like recommender systems. This was an example of **unsupervised** learning. Unsupervised learning is a collection of techniques in machine learning (ML) the goal of which is to extract information from unlabelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we look at **supervised learning**. The goal of supervised learning is to predict a label of a sample given some input data. The two main types of problems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classification, where we try to classify the data into $n$ classes (ex. classify pictures of pets into \"dog\", \"cat\" and \"other\").\n",
    "2. Regression, where we try to predict a continuous variable (ex. predict a price of a product given its description).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a third paradigm called **reinforcement learning** where the goal is to learn from experience. It is used to train computer agents to perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will cover the main concepts of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more interesting, we will do this by going over a possible workflow for creating a simple classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset). This dataset has info on passengers of the Titanic and whether they survived the sinking."

    "2. Numerical - where the feature is some real variable (ex. fare, age).\n",

    "\n",
    "Categorical data is usually represented in a model through **one hot encoding**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In one hot encoded data a categorical variable is represented by vector of length $k,$ where $k$ is the number of classes. The vector has all entries equal to $0$ except one where it has the value $1.$ I.e. the class gets encoded using the position of the vector. Null values are usually treated as a separate class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one possible one hot encoding of the feature `Embarked` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `S`: (1, 0, 0, 0)\n",
    "- `C`: (0, 1, 0, 0)\n",
    "- `Q`: (0, 0, 1, 0)\n",
    "- `null`: (0, 0, 0, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even when the categories are represented by numbers (ex. passenger class) it is still a good idea to use one hot encoding because it removes the implicit and usually wrong ordinal relationship of the variable.\n",
