    "# Course Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introductory course on machine learning (ML).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is concerned with developing statistical algorithms that learn from data and are able to generalize to novel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Knowing a bit of the Python programming language\n",
    "2. Some linear algebra\n",
    "3. A small amount of multivariable calculus (only derivatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use these standard python packages throughout the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Numpy]() - package for scientific computing\n",
    "2. [Pandas]() - implements dataframes\n",
    "3. [Sklearn]() - implements classical ML algorithms\n",
    "4. [PyTorch]() - framework for building artificial neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The marks for this course will be assigned as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exam - 4 marks\n",
    "2. Homework Project - 6 marks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam\n",
    "\n",
    "Exam will consist of 4 questions worth 1 mark each.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be allowed to use notes during the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find example topics for the homework project [here](https://jputrius.github.io/ml_intro/). Your are free to choose whichever topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come up with your own idea for a topic then you can do it instead. However, before starting work please discuss the topic with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework Project\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options to turn in your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload a zip file containing you project files to the [emokymai](https://emokymai.vu.lt/) task that I will create.\n",
    "2. (Preferred) Create a repository on Github / Gitlab / etc. containing your project. Then upload a txt file containing a link to your repository to the [emokymai](https://emokymai.vu.lt/) task that I will create. Make sure that your repository is publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "The slides used to give these lectures can be found [here](https://jputrius.github.io/ml_intro/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some optional books I recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Hands-On Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) - good introduction to ML.\n",
    "2. [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/) - goes deeper into the mathematics of ML.\n",
    "3. [Machine Learning Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-Preparation/dp/1098115783) - a very useful read if you are looking to get a job as a data scientist / ML engineer.\n",
    "4. [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf) - intro to the math of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is usually not covered in books that focus on general machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extras\n",
    "\n",
    "These slides were made using [quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/jputrius/ml_intro/tree/main).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not cover [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) in this course, but I suggest that you learn it. Here is a good [resource](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing python packages and environments. I encourage you to use it as well for your homework project."
